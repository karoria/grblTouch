This is a basic but working webUI project based on websockets protocol. Do the necessary modifications in app.js within starting lines (appropriate comments are written to guide the user) and save the file.

We strongly recommend to use "FTP" for any file transfer to and fro SD card by a suitable free software like "FileZilla".
